In this segment, we'll provide a preview
of what you'll be doing in your Spark coding lab this week.
The goal of the lab is to implement a regression pipeline
for predicting a song's release year from audio features,
and to do so using the various tools we discussed
in this week's lecture.
The raw data consists of a subset of the Millionsong
Dataset from the University of California, Irvine, Machine
Learning Repository.
During the lab, you will explore the raw features,
process the labels to make them more interpretable,
and visualize the raw data.
You'll then split the data into training, validation,
and test data sets.
After you've done this, you'll need
to perform feature extraction to feed into a supervised learning
model.
At first, you'll use the raw features, and towards the end
of the lab, you'll compute quadratic features
and compare the results.

Given a set of features-- either the initial features
or the quadratic features-- you will
train various linear regression models.
You first implement gradient descent
from scratch for linear regression,
and then use the MLlib implementation
for ridge regression.
You will also visualize the performance of this training
process to gain intuition.

Since you'll be using ridge regression,
you'll need to search for a good value for its regularization
hyperparameter, and you will use grid search
to identify an appropriate value.
You will evaluate all models using RMSE
and visualize the grid-search process
to better understand the hyperparameter search space
that you're exploring over.
Finally, you will evaluate the final model using RMSE
and compare its accuracy to that of a simple baseline that
always predicts the average song year from the training data.
The final model you train could, in theory,
be used to make some predictions for new songs,
but this won't be explored as part of this lab.
